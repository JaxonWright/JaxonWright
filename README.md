### Hello human,

My name is Jaxon. I am primarily an Angular Developer that has a keen eye for UI/UX. ech is evolving around us, quicker and quicker. Advances in technology have made so many things in the world easier to do, and made the impossible possible. I love being in the field of making the world a better place through innovative technologies. I mostly enjoy developing software that other people will use to make their lives better and aid them throughout their day. That is the main attraction to software development for me; making things that others enjoy and find useful.
